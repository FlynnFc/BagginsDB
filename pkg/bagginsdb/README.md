**Tiger Style Coding Practices: Middle-earth Edition ðŸ§™**  
_Inspired by the wisdom of the Fellowship and the strength of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth._

### **General Principles**

1. **"One Codebase to Rule Them All"**  
   Your project must remain unified, like the Free Peoples uniting against Sauron. Every file, every function, every variable must have its place in the grand scheme, working harmoniously toward a single goal: the defeat of chaos (bugs).

2. **"Speak, Friend, and Enter"**  
   Your code should be as clear and welcoming as the gates of Moria (when you know the riddle). Name variables and functions wisely so others can understand them without needing a wizard's guidance.

3. **"Not All Who Wander Are Lost"**  
   Stray not into sprawling logic. Follow a clear path like Aragorn tracking the Uruk-hai. Each function and module must have a singular, well-defined purpose.

4. **"Even the Smallest Function Can Change the Course of the Codebase"**  
   Like Frodo and Sam, never underestimate the power of small, efficient functions. Break tasks into manageable chunks, and let no function bear the burden of too many responsibilities.

### **The Fellowship of Formatting**

1. **"Keep It Secret, Keep It Safe"**  
   Your private methods and variables must stay hidden, just as the One Ring was hidden from Sauron. Encapsulation is your ally.

2. **"There Is Always Hope (For Readability)"**  
   Indent consistently, use spaces wisely, and align your comments like the bows of LothlÃ³rien archers. A clean and elegant codebase is a joy to traverse.

3. **"Do Not Meddle in the Code of Wizards (Unless It's Documented)"**  
   Comment your code, but sparingly and meaningfully. Leave notes like Gandalf's runes, guiding future travelers but not over-explaining what should already be clear.

### **Control Flows: The Paths of the Dead**

1. **"Frodo Was Meant to Have This Code"**  
   Pass only the necessary data through your functions. Like the One Ring, avoid passing excessive baggageâ€”it only burdens the journey.

2. **"The Road Goes Ever On and On"**  
   Avoid infinite loops and convoluted recursion. Write your control flows with the care of an elf weaving a cloak: precise and purposeful.

3. **"A Shortcut to What? Mushrooms?"**  
   Avoid hacks and quick fixes. They may seem tempting, but they lead to the ruin of your codebase, like a NazgÃ»l finding its prey.

### **Error Handling: Beware the Balrog**

1. **"You Shall Not Pass"**  
   Validate your inputs rigorously, stopping bad data like Gandalf halting the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dÃ»m.

2. **"Fly, You Fools"**  
   Fail fast and provide clear error messages. Guide the developer away from danger, like Gandalf urging the Fellowship out of Moria.

3. **"What About Second Errors?"**  
   Chain your error handling carefully. Do not let one bug spawn another, as Gollum's treachery led Frodo into Shelobâ€™s lair.

### **Testing: "For the DÃºnedain!"**

1. **"There Can Be No Triumph Without Loss"**  
   Every feature must be tested, for even the strongest code has weaknesses. Let your tests reveal them like a PalantÃ­r revealing Sauron's gaze.

2. **"The Ring Has Awoken... Itâ€™s Time for Regression Tests"**  
   As Isildurâ€™s failure doomed NÃºmenor, so too will your neglect of regression testing doom your code. Protect against old bugs returning.

3. **"A Day May Come When Bugs Break Our Build... But It Is Not This Day!"**  
   Ensure your tests run automatically with every build. Continuous integration is your watchtower against the forces of Mordor.

### **Code Reviews: The Council of Elrond**

1. **"Even the Wise Cannot See All Ends"**  
   Seek the counsel of your peers. A second pair of eyes may catch what youâ€™ve missed, just as Elrond foresaw the risks of the Fellowshipâ€™s journey.

2. **"And What About Very Old Pull Requests?"**  
   Close stale PRs quickly. Do not let them linger like forgotten tomes in Sarumanâ€™s library.

3. **"Strength in Unity"**  
   Work collaboratively, and respect the contributions of others. Remember, the success of the codebase depends on every member of the Fellowship.
